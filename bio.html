        <h1> Biography </h1>
        <p> I was born in a small town of the coast of central chile, since my school times i was interested in computers,
            but i always use windows from an user level. After school i studied to become a bartender, and with this knowledge
            i travel across my country, starting in low level restaurant and finishing in the top 3 Hotel of south América.
            During that time i was also interested in literature, so i wrote and publish a book, earning a national award in a short stories contest of
            the Minister of Culture. In 2013 i came to Sweden for first time, as a tourist, where i meet the love of my life, 
            travelling to Chile and living there together. We got married in 2016 and came back to Sweden to create a family and to be part of
             this great country.
             Since my arrival i worked first as a technician in Perific AB and in CaCharge AB in stockholm, testing apps for
             house automatization products and assembling and testing electric car chargers.
             I later on with my family came to live in Skåne and start working again as a bartender in Pinchos, Ängelholm.
             We have already 2 kids and i am starting this adventure of becoming a programmer.
